# SWE 573
SWE 573 - Software Development practice, is a course given to upper graduate students of Software Engineering
 in Bogazici University. During Spring 2020 term, I will be attending the course that is teached 
 by [Suzan Üsküdarlı](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~uskudarli/). Most of my work for the course 
is included in this repo. I will update it regularly until the term ends.


Homework and the related research can be found in [issues](https://github.com/mutisama/swe573/issues). 
The detailed information is discussed in [wiki](https://github.com/mutisama/swe573/wiki) section.
